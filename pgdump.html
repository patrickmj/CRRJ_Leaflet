When he arrived at the jail following the second arrest, Kennedy allegedly said, \"I have been in that jail once and you are not going to put me in that jail again.\" Kennedy allegedly fought the officers on the way up two flights of stairs to the warden's office. The officers claim that Kennedy and an officer fell down the stairs. An autopsy was ordered to determine cause of death. The results are unknown. No legal action was taken.",

The officer alleged that Watson fought him, although Watson was handcuffed and unarmed at the time of the shooting. Selma officers reported that on the night of the homicide they went up to Watson's car in response to a report of a disturbance. Watson had been driving friends home when his car ran out of gas. When the police arrived, Watson informed them that his car ran out of gas. Reportedly the police placed Watson under arrest and tried to start his car. When Watson protested that further attempts to start his car would deplete its battery, the officers got angry and struck him in the face and then shot him in the street. In a report to the NAACP, Watson's wife, Ethel Watson, attested that her husband's body was bruised and that there were \"large gaping holes\" on his forehead and under his cheek bone. On October 31, 1946, Selma resident Wiley B. Moore took a statement from Ethel Watson and made a report to the FBI in Birmingham and Washington urging action. Moore made clear that Watson's case was just one example of the pervasive police brutality against blacks. On February 25, 1947, Assistant Attorney General Theron Caudle wrote, \"Under these circumstances, it is not believed that prosecution could be successful.\"",

Two other African American men, Amos Crosby and John Gallington were also shot by Weeks as he fired several times at Williams. Both Williams and the conductor were charged with assault with intent to commit murder. Detective Charles Pierce explained Williams was charged because the conductor had lacerations. One week later, November 28, 1949, Williams died from the gunshot wounds sustained to his chest and abdomen, which resulted in injuries to his left lung and kidney. The charges against Weeks were not amended to reflect murder. The outcome of the original charge is unknown. Week's permit to carry a firearm expired 11 years prior.",

An NAACP letter dated October 30, 1930, noted that months prior, a mob of white men went to Robertson's home to lynch his family. The tension stated when Clarence Boyd wanted Newton Robertson to pay for a battery. An altercation took place and one member of the Robertson family was killed along with two white men, Grover Boyd and Charley Marrs. A white mob was determined to kill the Robertson family. They burned Newton Robertson's home and may have killed him and his nephew Essu Robertson. The white community had Tom and Ernest Robertson charged with the murders of Grover Boyd and Charley Marrs, even though they had nothing to do with the original incident. Tom Robertson was sentenced to death and Ernest Robertson to ten years. Newton Robertson's name appeared on a \"soliciting list\" sent to the Secretary of the East St. Louis NAACP branch in October of 1930. This claim is echoed in press reports from Danville, Kentucky and Troy, Alabama. It is possible that Reverend Newton Robinson escaped and the author of the \"soliciting list\" did not know. The July 7, 1930, NY Herald Tribune, which get details wrong, reported that a wounded Newton man was in a \"Negro cabin\" in West Bessemer. To complicate things more, the Washington post and the Atlanta Journal reported that rumors of anyone being burned alive were unfounded since no bodies were located.",

Grace Tabor, 23 years old, Lorena Tidwell, 19 years old, and Edith Tidwell, 24 years old, reported that they were walking to a church meeting when a black man threatened to kill them and forced Grace and Lorena to run ahead. Edith ran to get help. A citizens' posse of about 25-30 white men chased George Taylor, 26 years old, who reportedly fired shots behind him. Taylor ran into an alleyway, where he was cornered by the mob and shot in the head. He was taken to the hospital and identified by the women. He never regained consciousness and died that evening. His death certificate lists the cause of death as a homicide by gunshot wounds to the head. A police report was filed by the women, detailing the events. The Birmingham Branch of the NAACP classified this as a lynching and included it in their 1934 annual report. The specific shooter within the mob was not identified. The newspaper reported that the police praised the citizen posse for protecting the women. We are not aware of any legal action taken.",

Mann's mother, Burler Mann, stated that her son was falsely accused of stealing Stephens' tools. On July 23, Stephens called the police, who investigated and found the tools. Mann was ordered to leave the premises. Before he left he asked his neighbor who hired him to do some yard-work, for a 25 cent loan. Stephens and another white man saw Mann and accused him of stealing his shirt, which Mann denied. Stephens shot him in the side. Stephen's friend then drove Stephens and Mann back to the shop and concocted a story that the shooting was an accident. Mann was taken to the hospital, where he provided a statement that he was intentionally, and not accidentally, shot by Stephens. Mann died 7 days later. Including the neighbor who hired Mann, there were a number of African American eye-witnesses. Mann's mother hired an attorney, Mr. Houston, who interviewed the mother and others. The Birmingham NAACP employed a local attorney, Mr. Smith. Stephens, testified he shot in self-defense, as did the first Officer on the scene, J.M. Maynor. On the other hand, Officer DeGroat, who heard Mann's final statement, was a strong witness for the state. Stephens was jailed, unable to make $5,000 bond. The outcome of the trial is unknown.",

However, Judge Frank Embry dismissed the case stating that the cause of death was not determined. In 1997, as a result of requests by Willie Edwards' daughter, Malinda Edwards, District Attorney Brooks working with State Medical Examiner Dr. James Lauridson opened a fresh investigation. Based on Edwards' remains, Dr. Lauridson ruled the cause of death to be a homicide by having been forced to jump into the Alabama River. Brooks filed a motion to have Edwards' death certificate reflect Dr. Lauridson's findings. Judge Charles Price ordered the Alabama Department of Vital Statistics to change Edwards' cause of death from unknown to homicide. District Attorney Brooks took the case back to the Montgomery County Grand Jury in 1999. The Grand Jury declined to return an indictment.",

Huey insisted that a black veteran, Australia Farrow, give him his cane. Farrow resisted. Huey and Charles Chester, cornered Farrow, and Huey drew a knife. Farrow hit Huey on the head with a stick, and fled. Huey told Officer Otis Smith he would go to Pecan Alley, the black section of Camp Hill, to \"run all Negroes out of the streets because they had no damn business being there.\" Huey and a group of white men, including Luke Langley, Camp Hill's former police chief, and Otis Smith and Otis Rogers, the police force of Camp Hill. Huey created an incredible disturbance, chasing and beating women. Huey entered the Veterans Café, went into the black section, and assaulted people. Because Noyes was five months pregnant, she could not move quickly, and so, when everyone began to run, she was at the back of the crowd. She was shot once by Huey, then he kicked Noyes and told he told her to run. She began to run, and he shot her a second time. Noyes made it out of the café and collapsed on Emory Reeves, a white woman's porch. Reeves gave Noyes water. By the time her family arrived, Noyes was dead. Huey was arrested by Dadeville County Deputy Sheriff Horace Aiken. He was held on $1,000 bond, which he posted the following afternoon. Otis Smith claimed he did not restrain Huey because his arm was sore. Farrow was arrested and charged with attempted murder and held on $1,000 bond. A hearing was set for Huey and Farrow for June 2, 1947. Noyes' father, Tom Erwin, authorized the Southern Negro Youth Congress to obtain legal counsel in order to file a suit. Nesbitt Elmore, of the firm James, Elmore & Adair, based in Montgomery, Alabama, was hired, to partner with a local lawyer, Sims Wilbank, of Alexander City, Alabama, who was retained by Farrow's father. It is unclear whether the hearing, or any legal process occurred.",
